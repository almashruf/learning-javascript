In JavaScript, variables can be declared using the `var`, `let`, and `const` keywords. Each keyword has different properties and usage scenarios.

### 1. `var`

The `var` keyword has been used since the inception of JavaScript. Variables declared with `var` are function-scoped and can be re-declared and updated.

```javascript
// Example using var
var name = "Alice";
console.log(name); // Output: Alice

var name = "Bob";
console.log(name); // Output: Bob
```

### 2. `let`

The `let` keyword was introduced in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) and is block-scoped, meaning it is limited to the block, statement, or expression where it is used. Variables declared with `let` can be updated but not re-declared within the same scope.

```javascript
// Example using let
let age = 25;
console.log(age); // Output: 25

age = 30; // Update the variable
console.log(age); // Output: 30

// let age = 35; // This would cause an error: Identifier 'age' has already been declared
```

### 3. `const`

The `const` keyword, also introduced in ES6, is also block-scoped but is used to declare variables that are read-only (constants). The value of a `const` variable cannot be changed through reassignment, and it cannot be re-declared.

```javascript
// Example using const
const pi = 3.14159;
console.log(pi); // Output: 3.14159

// pi = 3.14; // This would cause an error: Assignment to constant variable

// const pi = 3.14; // This would also cause an error: Identifier 'pi' has already been declared
```

### Example in HTML with JavaScript

Here's an example demonstrating the use of `var`, `let`, and `const` in an HTML document:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Variable Declarations in JavaScript</title>
    <script>
        // Using var
        var greeting = "Hello, World!";
        console.log(greeting);

        // Using let
        let username = "Alice";
        console.log(username);

        // Using const
        const pi = 3.14159;
        console.log(pi);

        // Trying to reassign or redeclare variables
        greeting = "Hello, Universe!";
        console.log(greeting); // Output: Hello, Universe!

        username = "Bob";
        console.log(username); // Output: Bob

        // pi = 3.14; // Uncommenting this line would cause an error
    </script>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Check the console for variable declarations and outputs</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

### Summary

- **`var`**: Function-scoped, can be re-declared and updated.
- **`let`**: Block-scoped, can be updated but not re-declared in the same scope.
- **`const`**: Block-scoped, read-only (cannot be updated or re-declared).

Use `let` and `const` for better scoping control and to avoid issues associated with `var` in larger codebases.
